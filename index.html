    <p><strong>â€¢ Hi! I'm Nora â€¢</strong></p>
    <p>

        
        As an SPD master student, I fit the analytical role. I love having a view
        on the <strong>bigger lines</strong> and trying to connect them into <strong>future possibilities.</strong>
        Achieving that, for me, takes understanding the full context. As an
        <strong>empathetic</strong> person my abilities comprehend the understanding, as a
        <strong>curious & driven person</strong> my abilities comprehend of putting the effort &
        time in <strong>researching, analyzing and framing</strong>.
        As a future designer of products and services I am striving to find balance in how
        they fit the world we're living in. During the internship, I hope to be able to find this balance.
