    <p><strong>Hi! I'm Nora.</strong></p>
    <p>s

        I'm currently looking for an <strong>internship</strong> that fits my interests. 
        As an SPD master student, I fit the analytical role. I love having a view
        on the <strong>bigger lines</strong> and trying to connect them into <strong>future possibilities.</strong>
        Achieving that, for me, takes understanding the full context. As an
        <strong>empathetic</strong> person my abilities comprehend the understanding, as a
        <strong>curious & driven person</strong> my abilities comprehend of putting the effort &
        time in <strong>researching, analyzing and framing</strong>.
        As a future designer of products and services I am striving to find balance in how
        they fit the world we're living in. As I learned during my bachelor
        Industrial Design Engineering products are one of the main waste
        streams created by us humans, I got in conflict. <em>"How can I design
        products and maintain the world altogether?"</em>. I started exploring the
        answer to this question by working with new emerging materials
        during my minor Advanced Prototyping & by getting myself familiar with
        circularity which resulted in me participating in Blue City's Circular
        Challenge. During the internship, I hope to be able to find an answer to the question above.
